# hello-world
Alan's first project

Hello.

My interest in deleoping or coding began when I bought a heavily modified smartphone off the street. I'm still working on it. 

Learning about the capabilities of simple apps or software meant to collect data put fear in my heart. In spite of that I wanted the power to learn the secrets of development, how to access tha data of others, turning my devices into virtual Fort Knoxes. 

Information (data) is power, and I want to be the one who knocks. Also I really enjoy tweaking software and devices. 

My journey with developemnt begins here. I have along way to go cause I don't know shit. 

Alan
